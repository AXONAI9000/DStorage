# Add Dashboard Mock Data

## Description
This change proposes adding mock data generation for the dashboard component to provide realistic sample data for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.

## Rationale
Currently, the dashboard component requires real data to display meaningful content. This makes it difficult to:
- Develop and test the UI without a backend connection
- Demonstrate the application's capabilities
- Create consistent test scenarios
- Onboard new developers who need to see the app in action

Adding mock data will:
- Enable immediate visualization of the dashboard's full potential
- Provide consistent test data for development
- Support demonstration and documentation efforts
- Improve developer experience by removing dependency on backend

## Impact
### Components Affected
- `src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Will be modified to accept mock data
- `src/lib/types.ts` - May need minor updates for mock data generation
- `src/App.tsx` - May need updates to pass mock data

### New Files
- `src/lib/mockData.ts` - New mock data generation utility

## Dependencies
No external dependencies required. Will use existing TypeScript interfaces and utility functions.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Create mock data generation utility (1 day)
- **Phase 2**: Update Dashboard component to use mock data (0.5 day)
- **Phase 3**: Add mock data integration to App component (0.5 day)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and refinement (0.5 day)

Total estimated time: 2.5 days
